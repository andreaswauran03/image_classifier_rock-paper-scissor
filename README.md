## Fake News Detection Project
```
We are happy to invite you to our image classification project! This project has a focus on image classification based on three well-known hand movements, namely scissors, rock, and paper. How do we do it? We use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the main algorithm to train our model. But that's not all! We also perform data augmentation, a technique that allows us to enrich and expand the training dataset. Let's explore the world of image classification together and dig deeper into the details of this process
